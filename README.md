## Extending the Simulator

You can extend the simulator by providing links to your own .NET Standard assemblies, and reference them from your simulation model.
To extend the simulator, create classes that implement the [ISimulationNode](TAG.Simulator/ISimulationNode.cs) interface, defined in the 
[TAG.Simulator](TAG.Simulator) library. The classes must implement the public a constructor taking a `ISimulationNode` argument representing
its parent node, and a `Model` parameter, representing the simulation model in which the object is created. To extend the simulator with new 
types of actors (for instance, new communication protocols), these classes must also implement the [IActorNode](TAG.Simulator/IActorNode.cs) 
interface, or derive from the [Actor](TAG.Simulator/ObjectModel/Actors/Actor.cs) class.

Following is a list of extension modules provided in the repository:

| Example                                                | Description                                                                                                            |

## Script extensions

You can extend the script engine using in the simulator, by implementing new functions or custom parsers. See
[Script reference](https://lab.tagroot.io/Script.md) for more information. Any assembly you reference in your simulation model
that contains script extensions, will automatically be used to extend the script engine of the simulator.

The simulator itself provides the following extensions:

| Entity   | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| `Model`  | A predefined variable pointing to the simulation model being executed. |
| `Global` | A set of global variables. Accessible across events. Variables used in event handlers are accessible only from that event handler. |

## Schema Files

Syntax of simulation nodes are defined in XML Schema files. The following table lists XML Schema files defined by the project:

| Schema                                                                          | Namespace                                                   | Description                                                                                                            |
