# ComSim

The TAG *Network Communication Simulator* (or *TAG ComSim*) is a *white-label* console utility application written in C# provided by [Trust Anchor Group](https://trustanchorgroup.com/)
(**TAG** for short). It can be used to simulate network communication traffic in large-scale networks. Features:

* **Extensible**: It can be extended by external modules to provide support for new features, communication protocols, etc.
* **Scriptable**: Logic can be provided through use of [script](https://lab.tagroot.io/Script.md).
* **Models**: Models are defined in XML files, and include support for defining:
	* Actors
	* Probability Distributions
	* Actions
	* Events
	* Statistics
	* Report Output

## Command-line arguments

The *TAG ComSim* console application is run from a command-prompt. Command-line arguments are as follows:

| Argument               | Description |
|:-----------------------|:------------|
| `-i FILENAME`          | Specifies the filename of the model to use during simulation. The file must be an XML file that conforms to the http://trustanchorgroup.com/Schema/ComSim.xsd namespace. Schema: [ComSim.xsd](ComSim/Schema/ComSim.xsd) in the repository. |
| `-d APP_DATA_FOLDER`   | Points to the application data folder. Required if storage of data in a local database is necessary for the simulation. (Storage can include generated user credentials so that the same user identities can be used across simulations.) |
| `-e`                   | If encryption is used by the database. Default=no encryption. |
| `-bs BLOCK_SIZE`       | Block size, in bytes. Default=8192. |
| `-bbs BLOB_BLOCK_SIZE` | BLOB block size, in bytes. Default=8192. |
| `-enc ENCODING`        | Text encoding. Default=UTF-8 |
| `-?`                   | Displays command-line help. |

## Examples

Following is a list of simulation examples that can be used as the basis for new simulation models:

| Example                                                   | Descriptio                                                                 |
|:----------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [SimpleChatMessages.xml](Examples/SimpleChatMessages.xml) | Simulates a few users using XMPP to send chat messages between each other. |
